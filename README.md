# P2P Chat and VoIP Application using UDP in Java

This repository contains the codebase of the **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Chat and VoIP application** which will be developed as the main assignment for the **Computer Networks II** course. This course is taught as part of the curiculum of the **Electrical and Computer Engineering** department of the **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH)** during the **2024-2025** academic year.

## üìö Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a simple Peer-to-Peer (P2P) application that enables real-time chat and Voice over IP (VoIP) communication utilizing the UDP protocol in Java. This application will be based on  `java.net` to handle network communications, providing a foundational understanding of network programming, concurrency, and instant messaging and multimedia dataexchange between two peers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - `java.net` for networking
  - `javax.sound` for audio capture and playback
- **Protocols:**
  - UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for communication
- **Tools:**
  - Git for version control
  - Maven for build automation and project management for Java projects

## ‚ú® Features

- Instant messaging and voice data exchange using UDP
- Simplistic Graphic User Interface (GUI) instead of command line implementation
- Multithreaded architecture to enable concurent instant messaging and VoIP functionalities
